%% This function makes a ring shaped mask for the radial symmetry kernels
% one way is to go via the circle equation, the other is via the angle theta.
% this one takes the circle equation approach, its slower but more accurate

% inputs: - r:     radius of the ring
%         - rmax:  size of the image
%                  if not given, its equal to r
% outputs: - img:  image with the circle
